            <p class="why">
          I have spent the last 14 years working in various roles as a Customer Service Specialist. At some point during 2021 I decided<br>
          that I wanted more for myself but I had no idea what that was. I gave it some thought and at first I thought "why not become<br>
          a sparky or try a trade..?" but ultimately I considered my current age and the inevitable wear and tear that would have on my body.<br>
          I have a friend who became a Web Developer through Dev Academy and she suggested that I take a look. IT has always been something<br>
          of interest to me, I just never knew where to start. So, I signed up, attended the Open Evening and had a listen at what the Dev<br>
          Experience was like. I immediately was intriguied and decided that this was it, this is the something more I was looking for.<br>
          And so here I am, hoping to become a successful Web Developer, this won't be easy but if it was I wouldn't be here.

          <h2 class="about-4">What Are My Strengths</h2>
            <p class="strengths">After discussing this with my Partner, she listed the following:
              <ul class="strengths-1">
                <li>Compassionate</li>
                <li>Empathetic</li>
                <li>Perfectionist</li>
                <li>Selfless</li>
                <li>Family Oriented</li>
                <li>Excellent Listener</li>
                <li>Loving</li>
                <li>Hospitable</li>
                <li>Resourceful</li>
                <li>Equitable</li>
              </ul><br>
              Not going to lie, I wasn't expecting this list to be as long as it is but, when you've been with someone for over 10 years<br>
              I guess it has to be true right? In any case I have picked these strengths up over the years in both my professional career<br>
              and in my social life. I have my Family to thank for a lot of these as well as my own loving little Family.
