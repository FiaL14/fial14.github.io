      <h2><strong>Identity & Values</strong></h2><br>
      
      <div>

        <h3>Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values.</h3><br>

        <h4>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved<br>
            in that decision, the decision you made, and the consequences of your action.</h4><br>

        <p>I'm sure everyone can say that they have been asked for money or spare change at least once in their life.<br>
        I know I certainly have, and one particular time in my late teens always sticks out for me. A man outside of the bus stop that<br>
        used to be across the road from Area 51 on Cuba Street, stopped me and asked for $10. I obviously didn't know the guy and $10<br>
        to me at the time was a lot. Usually I would have said no, but this time was different. I considered that he might use the money<br>
        to support a bad habit, or even purchase something illegal. I asked him what it was for and he replied saying he needed it to get<br>
        home. I then considered that if he really did need it to get home and I could help him, then why not. Besides, if this guy had<br>
        kids or something to get back to then I should help him. After a back and forth conversation I decided, what the heck and helped him out.<br>
        I actually gave him $20 because I didn't have anything smaller on me, and I also couldn't be bothered breaking it. After handing him<br>
        the money, he shook my hand and said "REALLY?!" and I could see how genuinely happy this dude was. He actually leant in for a hug to say<br>
        thanks too, being a big hugger myself I allowed it lol.<br>
        After that, I waited with him for the bus, he waved goodbye and that was that. I sat at the bus stop for awhile after he left to think<br>
        about what just happened. It was such a random and small act of kindness but for some reason that left a lasting impression on me that<br>
        I have never forgotten. Since then I adopted a new motto "If you can help, then help. If you can't, then try your best" which<br>
        I have applied in everything that I do. I love helping people out in any way that I can, seeing and hearing the joy in people you've<br>
        helped always gives me more meaning. Over the years I've continued to practice this in all of my Customer Service roles and I would now<br>
        like to do that as a Web Developer.</p><br><br>

        <h4>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h4><br>

        <p>Having grown up in a Samoan home meant a lot of things. I grew up with a strong religious belief which gave me<br>
        an understanding of Jesus, which then translated into me learning to be kind, caring and loving towards others. Being able to speak<br>
        another language also made me aware that not everyone communicates the same and that each language is unique and not to judge others<br>
        in how they speak. Being brown also taught me that not everyone will view me the same, that there are others out there that would judge<br>
        me based on my appearance instead of my merit and achivements. This was something I would not completely understand until I was in my<br>
        early teens. Once I understood this, I ensured to try to treat everyone I encounter with the same dignity and respect that I would want, and<br>
        always try to remember that not everyone has or had the same things that I may or may not have had, so never to judge as it's not within<br>
        my right and to be grateful for what I have and try not to take it for granted. Lifes too short and I want to live it up with those I love<br>
        and with as many friends as I can make while I'm alive. Living is alive, but living alone is death.</p><br><br>

        <h3>Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.</h3><br>

        <h4>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development.</h4><br>

          <p>After discussing this with my Partner, she listed the following:
            <ul>
              <li>Compassionate</li>
              <li>Empathetic</li>
              <li>Perfectionist</li>
              <li>Selfless</li>
              <li>Family Oriented</li>
              <li>Excellent Listener</li>
              <li>Loving</li>
              <li>Hospitable</li>
              <li>Resourceful</li>
              <li>Equitable</li>
            </ul><br>
            </p>
          
          <p>Not going to lie, I wasn't expecting this list to be as long as it is but, when you've been with someone for over 10 years<br>
          I guess it has to be true right? In any case, I have picked these strengths up over the years in both my professional career<br>
          and in my social life. I am only limited in the effort I put into these values so if I dedicate myself whole heartedly in all these strengths then<br>
          I am confident that I will be successful.
          </p><br><br>

          <h4>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they intersect with learning obstacles.</h4><br>

          <p>I believe me being compassionate, loving, equitable, empathetic, selfless, hospitable and an excellent listener will help me work well with the other<br>
          cohorts, especially when it comes to the group projects during bootcamp. And then the same would apply for me being a perfectionist and resourceful<br>
          as these would apply in group projects and in solo projects. However, I am aware that being a perfectionist can be a double edge sword so I'll be extra<br>
          careful not to fall on it so to speak.</p><br><br>

          <h4>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss<br>
          the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h4><br>

            <p>In almost every role I've had working as a Customer Service Specialist, I've had to work in a team. Now that has never required me<br>
          to participate in team projects, but it does require us to work together to ensure that we all meet our targets for the month.<br>
          In a lot of cases we would need to strategise how we would be as productive as possible so we would meet these targets. On one occasion that I can recall,<br>
          I had somewhat of a run in with a colleague about how we should approach the upcoming month as we weren't doing well for that current month. I expressed<br>
          one opinion where my colleague expressed another which I didn't agree with. The discussion was going nowhere, it was starting to become awkward for the other<br>
          team members and so we needed a solution. In the end I ended up compromising with my colleague providing that we at least implement parts of my idea as a trial,</br>
          that way we try both in a sense and if it didn't work try one or the other. In the end we hit our target with that initial plan and all was well in the land.<br>
          Upon reflecting on this, I haven't actually done that until now but... If I could replay that whole scenario, I wouldn't exactly fold to the other persons idea,<br>
          I'd just suggest trying one idea, if that didn't work out then try mine. And then if neither work, well back tothe drawing board. No harm no foul, well not really.</p><br><br>

        <h2>Learning Plan</h2><br>

        <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3><br>

        <p>Learn as much from this course as I can and carry that knowledge into becoming a successful Web Developer.</p><br><br>

        <h3>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning.</h3><br>

        <p><strong>Strengths:</strong></p><br>
        <p>Persistent in finding the solution.</p><br>
        <p>Love learning new things (the more challenging the better because it feels that much greater once you understand).</p><br>
        <p>Team Player</p><br>
        <p>High curiosity which usually leads me to finding an answer.</p><br>
        <p>Fearless once I'm confident in what I'm doing.</p><br>
        <p>Passionate</p><br>
        <p>Can multi task (most of the time).</p><br><br>

        <p><strong>Concerns:</strong></p><br>
        <p>Since having children I can get easily distracted. A little hard to concentrate when you have a little minion biting at your ankles.</p><br>
        <p>Time Management.</p><br>
        <p>Knowing what to ask and how to ask for help when required. I'm typically not ashamed to ask for help, in this case though it feels a little different.</p><br>
        <p>My curiosity will lead me down rabit holes which will consume prescious time.</p><br>
        <p>Constant procrastinator.</p><br><br>
