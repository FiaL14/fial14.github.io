            <p class="why">

          I have spent the last 14 years working in various roles as a Customer Service Specialist. At some point during 2021 I decided<br>
          that I wanted more for myself but I had no idea what that was. I gave it some thought and at first I thought "why not become<br>
          a sparky or try a trade..?" but ultimately I considered my current age and the inevitable wear and tear that would have on my body.<br>
          I have a friend who became a Web Developer through Dev Academy and she suggested that I take a look. IT has always been something<br>
          of interest to me, I just never knew where to start. So, I signed up, attended the Open Evening and had a listen at what the Dev<br>
          Experience was like. I immediately was intriguied and decided that this was it, this is the something more I was looking for.<br>
          And so here I am, hoping to become a successful Web Developer, this won't be easy but if it was I wouldn't be here.
